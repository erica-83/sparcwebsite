        Dear <span class="fill-in">[Title and Name, e.g., Senator Smith]</span>,
    </div>

    <p>I am writing as the parent of an adult son/daughter with severe and multiple disabilities who lives in your district. I am asking you to support the SPARC (Specially Adapted Resource Centers) budget amendment currently before the General Assembly.</p>

    <p>SPARC provides integrated, community-based day services for adults with complex disabilities who are unable to work and require continuous one-to-one personal care support. This is the exact population Virginia has struggled - over decades - to serve in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Permanent Injunction issued against Virginia in <em>United States v. Virginia</em>.</p>

    <p>SPARC is not a pilot or a proposal. It is an established, fully operating program already delivering the integrated services the Commonwealth is legally required to provide - at substantially lower cost than Medicaid-funded day programs and with a significantly higher level of programming, including richer community integration, individualized engagement, and meaningful daily activities that far exceed the programs currently serving adults with complex needs.</p>

    <p>Funding SPARC is a strategic, direct, and cost effective way for Virginia to demonstrate measurable progress toward compliance with the Permanent Injunction.</p>

    <p>I urge you to support this budget amendment and help ensure that adults with severe disabilities in Virginia have access to the quality community-based services they deserve.</p>

        Sincerely,
